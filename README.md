# Pythonator
The aim of this project is to create a remote controlled drawer robot, including Android app and server.  
It works like this:
1. User takes picture of something to draw, and sends it to the server
2. The server constructs a set of lines from this image to draw, and sends it to the drawer bot
3. The drawer bot draws the lines


## Parts
There are 3 parts in this project: The app code, server code, and robot controller code.
Each part has its own README.

## Usage
0. Install app
1. Take a picture of something you want drawn
2. Send your picture to the server
3. Move to the drawer robot, once it has completed drawing, to collect your drawing
