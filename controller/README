Compilation instructions for the controller:

Note:
This program requires a bluetooth adapter and a usb port to be availlable on the host device. For the bluetooth adapter, libbluetooth must be available, which should be availlable on any Linux system with a bluetooth adapter.

First, install a modern C++ compiler, gcc version 7 was used for our project.

Next install OpenCV dependencies, the packages required are:
    -cmake
    -git
    -libgtk2.0-dev
    -pkg-config
    -libavcodec-dev
    -libavformat-dev
    -libswscale-dev
    -libtbb2
    -libtbb-dev
    -libjpeg-dev
    -libpng-dev

These packages can simply be installed with the package manger, which is apt-get on raspberry pi.

Next, download the OpenCV version 4.1.2 source code from https://opencv.org

Run the following commands in the source directory to compile and build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DOPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON
make
sudo make install

Note that the make can take a while to build OpenCV

After this, we can build our project by running make in the controller directory. This results in the pythonator-pi program.
